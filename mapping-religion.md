# Introduction

Begin with atlases on my desk.

I also have Laurie Maffly-Kipps's memorably titled review, "If It's
South Dakota You Must Be Episcopalian." Maffly-Kipp has dealt with many
of the major problems: how do we take what we know from categories and
put them on the map.

If I can sum up the critiques in two categories: "In the end, we are
still limited by data that is partial, ambiguous, and clearly slanted
toward things that can be counted and people that traditionally have
been seen as significant." Furthermore, the medium of the maps can only
express certain things. The authors of these atlases were not unaware of
these questions, and Maffly-Kipp "raise these concerns less as a
critique of the New Historical Atlas and more as a general
methodological lament" (MK 136).[^1] "It would be quite ironic if our
dazzling new technologies and spatial theories only brought us back to
much more circumscribed definitions of religious experience" (142).

First, it's not an entirely fair critique. Everything that is knowable
need not be mapped; some things can only be known from maps. Atlases
"must be used by teachers alongside other information that can give
students a fuller picture and a clear perspective on its (necessary)
limitations" (MK 139).

So my question today, based on two preliminary sets of maps, is what's
the next step in the dialectic. How do we get from the work of Gaustad
et al. to the next step, while taking into account Maffly-Kipp's
concerns? In particular, I'm going to focus on extending the kinds of
maps in Gaustad and Barlow's part 3, (in part added by Dishno) which are
a significant improvement, while trying to get some of the movement
depicted in Bret Carrol's atlas. I'm going to try to answer theoretical
questions with methodological improvements questions. Take a cue from
Johanna Drucker on humanities display of information. [^2]

My general argument is that there are large sources of data which
cartographers of religion have not used. They have not used them because
they are unaware of them: I dare say that the scholars who created the
atlases know the sources better than I currently do. Rather the problem
is one of resolution. Those sources weren't adapted because they could
never be meaningfully depicted in print atlases. The great difficulty
with this work is comparison, which forces you into a least
common-denominator approach, especially if you set your chronological
scope so big so that you're dealing with radically different sources.
Digital maps have the potential to improve some, but not all, of these
questions.

So within that framework, my aim is to show you two projects. The first
is a class I taught on mapping Boston's religions. And, since I've done
more interesting work since I submitted my abstract a year ago, I'm also
going to talk about that. Sketch out the sources and methods for digital
maps.

Laurie Maffly Kipp's question about whether by mapping we are giving up.
The question is does mapping give an illusion of precision where there
is none.

Yes, indeed digital technology has a great deal of hubris, and to repent
of this hubris would take a longer litany than we have time for today.

Mapping is a particularly egregious example: show the precision of the
typical point.

Time is another case in point: your computer internally represents time
as seconds from the Unix Epoch.

var longNineteenthCentury = ????

Our tools will do us no favors, especially if our tools were created by
computer scientists rather than humanists.

# Question stated

My question, then, is to bring three things into consideration. The
print atlases of religion that I love so much. The insights of
historians and scholars of religion. And the possibility of representing
data differently.

How can we make digital maps that take advantage of the change from
print to digital, while retaining the insights of religious studies.

I'm going to work with two projects.

-   Scale
-   Change over time
-   Identity

# Student project

Not going to talk about pedagogy.

Actually, the limitations of putting churches and people into boxes was
the best possible explanation of categories: race, religion,
denomination etc. I had intended to get that idea across, but

I'm a little reluctant to draw conclusions from this map.

# My own project

Atlases, one is impressed by how much history has gone into them, not
least in merging maps and texts. One is also impressed by how far they
have pushed the boundaries of the medium of print atlases. For example,
they make many attempts at showing movement.

-   Scale: In students' map

-   Resolution: In my congregationalist maps (Perhaps some historian of
    mathematics will tell me that arithmetic was done differently in the
    nineteenth century; but otherwise my arithmetic is better than these
    sources.) Can only see it in terms of the decades when we have data
    from the census. Notice that Gaustad's maps have X data points,
    while my map has Y data points. (And actually it represents 2
    variables about each data point.)
-   Arbitrary combination of data
-   Chasing individuals
-   Movement.
-   Shows the underlying data sets.
-   Change over time: through animation and movement. Constant scales
    across denominations and across time. All current atlases make a
    very serious mistake: each map is set on its own, rather than being
    able to be compared over time.

Derivative statistics. E.g. multimodal size of congregation.
Congregations likely to have ministers. Ministers in more than one
congregation. Ministers moving from congregations. Age of minster.

Lived religion: percentage of children baptized.

Severe limitations of the page can be escaped

Unacceptably misleading in the Gaustad atlas. It's all county level
data.

County level map of Gustad is simple to reproduce.

The problem is that the data is much better.

Drill down into the data yea even to the citations.

-   How many people were in the average congregational church.
-   African Americans

Moving of ministers from post to post and denomination to denomination.
Trace the history of several African American ministers.

What kinds of places have more than one church?

# Section on WPA slave narratives ?

# Self-criticisms

-   Fully aware that to do this kind of work requires denominationalism
    to make data visible. I'm confident that when we get more groups
    together we should be able to escape these constraints somewhat.
-   Congregationalists alone are not that interesting.
-   I'd say that there is great potential for integrating non-data
    sources, such. Chris's pedagogic practice, memoirs.

# Conclusion

Someone has said that that digital isn't going to save the humanities;
the humanities are going to save the digital.

But I'm not so sure it's obligatory that we retain all the insights of
text in. Because after all what can take us across the globe like words?
