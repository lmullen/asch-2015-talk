# Student project

Not going to talk about pedagogy.

Actually, the limitations of putting churches and people into boxes was
the best possible explanation of categories: race, religion,
denomination etc. I had intended to get that idea across, but

I'm a little reluctant to draw conclusions from this map.

For the census data itself, see NHGIS. [^3]

On the problem of census data. [^4]

# My own project

Atlases, one is impressed by how much history has gone into them, not
least in merging maps and texts. One is also impressed by how far they
have pushed the boundaries of the medium of print atlases. For example,
they make many attempts at showing movement.

-   Scale: In students' map

-   Resolution: In my congregationalist maps (Perhaps some historian of
    mathematics will tell me that arithmetic was done differently in the
    nineteenth century; but otherwise my arithmetic is better than these
    sources.) Can only see it in terms of the decades when we have data
    from the census. Notice that Gaustad's maps have X data points,
    while my map has Y data points. (And actually it represents 2
    variables about each data point.)
-   Arbitrary combination of data
-   Chasing individuals
-   Movement.
-   Shows the underlying data sets.
-   Change over time: through animation and movement. Constant scales
    across denominations and across time. All current atlases make a
    very serious mistake: each map is set on its own, rather than being
    able to be compared over time.

Derivative statistics. E.g. multimodal size of congregation.
Congregations likely to have ministers. Ministers in more than one
congregation. Ministers moving from congregations. Age of minster.

Lived religion: percentage of children baptized.

Severe limitations of the page can be escaped

Unacceptably misleading in the Gaustad atlas. It's all county level
data.

County level map of Gustad is simple to reproduce.

The problem is that the data is much better.

Drill down into the data yea even to the citations.

-   How many people were in the average congregational church.
-   African Americans

Moving of ministers from post to post and denomination to denomination.
Trace the history of several African American ministers.

What kinds of places have more than one church?

# Section on WPA slave narratives ?

# Self-criticisms

-   Fully aware that to do this kind of work requires denominationalism
    to make data visible. I'm confident that when we get more groups
    together we should be able to escape these constraints somewhat.
-   Congregationalists alone are not that interesting.
-   I'd say that there is great potential for integrating non-data
    sources, such. Chris's pedagogic practice, memoirs.

# Conclusion

Someone has said that that digital isn't going to save the humanities;
the humanities are going to save the digital.

But I'm not so sure it's obligatory that we retain all the insights of
text in. Because after all what can take us across the globe like words?
