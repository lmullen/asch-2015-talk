        Perhaps this is the place where we must admit, where we must finally 
        say, were we assert indubitably, that this is how life 
        works.

        The maps in the Gaustad atlas are by and large dependent on the 
        questions asked in the U.S. Census.

        I don't want to criticize them 
        overly, but there are two complaints. First that they are focused on 
        comparison across denominations. But second they have a problem with 
        trying to make everything local to the time and place.

        This census data on religion is mostly available in the <a 
          href="http://nhgis.org">National Historical GIS</a>. But far more 
        information is available in the census records. 
      </p>
    </section>
    <aside>

      The reliability of the censuses of religion has been defended in  
      Rodney Stark, “The Reliability of Historical United States Census 
      Data on Religion,” <i>Sociology of Religion</i> 53, no. 1 (1992): 
      91–95, doi:<a 
        href="http://socrel.oxfordjournals.org/content/53/1/91">10.2307/3711631</a>.

        Some of this is tracking down more information than simply number of 
        churches. (Number of churches, by the way, is a poor measure of 
        comparison, since Catholics and Jews for example had very large 
        congregations, while other denominations had very small 
        congregations.) The Census records contain far more information about 
        different denominations. I can't look at the volumes without learning 
        about some religious group I did not know about before. But there is 
        also more geographic specificity. Each of the censuses contains lists 
        of members and organizations in cities with more than 25,000 people. 
        None of us is likely to do a project on Council Bluffs, Iowa, or 
        Woonsocket, RI, but it is possible to know more than the Gaustad maps 
        come close to telling us.  For example, there are 292 cities of that 
        description in the 1926 census containing records by my count of 215 
        separate denominations.

        This is not <em>big data</em>. Computationally speaking, this is not 
        much data at all: it's just a couple steps above trivial. Historically 
        speaking, though, it is daunting. That means we are in a good place, 
        where we are doing the work of historians (digital historians).

        Big data, for my money, can be defined as data which cannot fit into 
        RAM, or data where the size of the data approaches the size of the 
        population. This is neither.

        In conclusion, given how little data we've actually had to work with, 
        it's not surprising that the maps we have are open to criticisms of 
        the sort made by Maffly-Kipp and others. Some of these problems are 
        inherent in the nature of mapping---you'll never find the autonomous 
        individual self, if there is such a thing---on a map like this. But 
        others are simply because we have not yet tapped the
