        On my desk I keep one reference work within easy reach: the <i>New 
          Historical Atlas of Religion in America</i>. It is not just that I 
        am fascinated by maps. When writing or teaching about any religious 
        group, I try to remember the dictum that I first learned from Jane 
        Kamensky: “events take place.” To bring place into my work, I need to 
        remind myself constantly of the where and when of American religious 
        history.

          Historical Atlas of Religion in America</i> (New York: Oxford 
        University Press, 2001).

      <p>
        But I also keep in mind Laurie Maffly-Kipps’s memorably titled essay 
        “If It’s South Dakota You Must Be Episcopalian.” In that essay 
        Maffly-Kipp reviews several atlases of American religion and makes a 
        number of telling critiques of the whole enterprise of mapping 
        religion, and indeed mapping in the humanities generally. Most of 
        these critiques can be lumped into two categories: sources and 
        definitions. First, sources: “We are still limited by data that is 
        partial, ambiguous, and clearly slanted toward things that can be 
        counted and people that traditionally have been seen as significant.” 
        In other words, our sources for making maps of religion aren’t very 
        good, and the best sources let us make maps of groups that we already 
        know a lot about. Second, definitions: Maffly-Kipp observes that our 
        “our dazzling new technologies and spatial theories” might only have 
        “brought us back to much more circumscribed definitions of religious 
        experience.” In other words, map-making requires us to create 
        categories, almost always denominational categories, when the whole 
        trend of religious history and religious studies is towards more 
        complex, layered understandings of religion.

        The scholars who have created the leading atlases of American religion 
        were not unaware of the theoretical questions raised by Maffly-Kipp, 
        and often raised them in their prefaces. Nor should we be overly 
        critical of the form of the <i>New Historical Atlas</i> or of Bret 
        Carrol's <i>Routledge Historical Atlas of Religion in America</i>. 
        When I look at these atlases, I see how they are straining the seams 
        of possibility when it comes to mapping in print. So my question is 
        this.  It seems to me that digital mapmaking means that we have new 
        possibilities for rethinking the forms and escaping the constraints of 
        mapmaking in print atlases (let alone in monographic scholarship). But 
        can digital mapmaking let us make maps which address the theoretical 
        constraints raised by both Maffly-Kipp and the mapmakers? How do we 
        get from the work of Gaustad
        et al. to the next step, while taking into account Maffly-Kipp's
        concerns?

        So within that framework, my aim is to show you two projects. The first
        is a class I taught on mapping Boston's religions. And, since I've done
        more interesting work since I submitted my abstract a year ago, I'm also
        going to sketch out the sources and methods for digital
        maps of religion on a much larger scale.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section class="text">
      <p>
        My general argument is that there are large sources of data which
        cartographers of religion have not used. They have not used them because
        they are unaware of them: I dare say that the scholars who created the
        atlases know the sources better than I currently do. Rather the problem
        is one of resolution. Those sources weren't adapted because they could
        never be meaningfully depicted in print atlases. The great difficulty
        with this work is comparison, which forces you into a least
        common-denominator approach, especially if you set your chronological
        scope so big so that you're dealing with radically different sources.
        Digital maps have the potential to improve some, but not all, of these
        questions. Our maps of religion so far have dealt with only a tiny 
        fraction of the information available to us. So I suggest that a 
        deeper map tells us more, and more humanistic, things about religious 
        history.
      </p>

      <p>
        Second, digital maps offer us many techniques for mapping. In 
        particular, they offer the possibility of dealing in more humanistic 
        Yes, indeed digital technology has a great deal of hubris, and to 
        repent of this hubris would take a longer litany than we have time for 
        today.  But I do think that digital maps offer the possibility for 
        better use of scale and change over time. While neither of these 
        entirely deals with the problem of mapping humanistically, they do 
        permit us to at least start to address these theoretical concerns. I'm 
        going to present this through a deep map of religion in Boston, and 
        then through a few extensive maps of Congregationalists.

        In the spring of 2014, I taught a course at Brandeis University on 
        mapping the religions of Boston. The class was a project based course 
        where the students did original research into the location of 
        congregations in Boston and created a map of the religious landscape 
        of the city as it changed over time. This mapmaking was framed with 
        readings and discussions about nineteenth-century religions in the 
        United States generally. Students looked at nineteenth-century maps of 
        Boston, city directories, and denominational records to find the 
        locations of congregations. They then developed a metadata model to 
        handle the information they had researched.
        Inside Omeka they created records for the congregations, including 
        information such as the date a congregation was formed and the date it 
        stopped existence, its street location, denomination, and any other 
        relevant information citations. Many of the records included 
        photographs or engravings of the church buildings. Churches were 
        pegged to a timeline, so that the changing composition of the city 
        could be shown dynamically. Students also 
        georectified original maps to put beneath their congregations to show 
        the changing landscape of the city. Keep in mind that about half of 
        Boston was reclaimed from the harbor or the Back Bay during the middle 
        of the nineteenth century. Finally, students created exhibits (web 
        essays, really) about particular aspects of what they had learned from 
        creating the map.

        I learned a lot about teaching such a project-based course, but that 
        is a discussion for another time.

        I wish to be cautious about about making historical claims from the 
        map. The class was very small, the students were all excellent but some 
        of the work was uneven, and frankly I had a lot to learn about teaching 
        this kind of course. In particular, I think the aims I set for the 
        students were bigger than the course size would have permitted. And so 
        I can't claim that we indentified all the congregations in the Boston 
        for that eighty year period, which would have taken a team of graduate 
        students much longer than a semester.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nevertheless, I can point out a number of methodological points that 
        this kind of deep mapping enabled us to learn. First, the ability to 
        animate the map was essential. One student who was interested in the 
        Methodist congregations was able to chart their spread throughout the 
        city. Methodists, like everybody else, started in the downtown section 
        of the city. But as new land opened in the Back Bay landfill, churches 
        moved to the west. We identified photos of churches in the Back Bay 
        where they were literally the only buildings in sight. By observing 
        movements connected to photographs, we were able to discuss the 
        significance of landscape—an observation only available through this 
        kind of deep mapping.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most important, students learned from creating this type of map to 
        think of religions as being part of an ecosystem. One student wrote 
        about the disputes between the "Bayer" (i.e., Bavarian) and the 
        "Polander" (i.e., Polish) synagogues. She was able to identify many of 
        the homes nearby K. K. Ohabei Shalom. The split between these 
        congregations over matters of culture and ritual later influenced the 
        settlement of Jews, who settled in different neighborhoods of the city 
        at different times.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section class="text">
      <p>
        Finally students thought deeply about the categories we had to use. So 
        far from mapping obscuring the categories we used, it was the central 
        means of discussing them. To be sure the demands of metadata were 
        difficulty. In discussing Ralph Waldo Emerson's “Divinity School 
        Address” with its call for his audience to be “Yourself a newborn bard 
        of the Holy Ghost, —cast behind you all conformity.” As we were 
        discussing the text, one student observed that Emerson would not have 
        found much use in our class project, because we were mapping 
        congregations rather than individuals, institutions rather than 
        prophets. Our map featured a city,when Emerson would have called us to 
        “nature.” It was a brilliant observation, because it used our reading 
        of Emerson’s text to interrogate the assumptions about religion and 
        society that underlay our class project: assumptions that I as the 
        instructor had required the students to go along with by assigning the 
        map in the first place. In our discussions the class agreed that 
        though Emerson had a point about individualism, most of the people in 
        Boston would not have so easily discarded the congregations that 
        sprung up across the city.

        The question is whether we can extend the kind of work that we are all 
        doing in cities to the United States more generally? We had in that 
        kind of a map an intimate look at neighborhoods. This is rather 
        different than the kinds of maps that Gaustad and others have created. 
        Ours spanned a city; their's spanned a nation.

        Some of this is tracking down more information than simply number of 
        churches. (Number of churches, by the way, is a poor measure of 
        comparison, since Catholics and Jews for example had very large 
        congregations, while other denominations had very small 
        congregations.) The Census records contain far more information about 
        different denominations. I can't look at the volumes without learning 
        about some religious group I did not know about before. But there is 
        also more geographic specificity. Each of the censuses contains lists 
        of members and organizations in cities with more than 25,000 people. 
        None of us is likely to do a project on Council Bluffs, Iowa, or 
        Woonsocket, RI, but it is possible to know more than the Gaustad maps 
        come close to telling us.  For example, there are 292 cities of that 
        description in the 1926 census containing records by my count of 215 
        separate denominations.

        This is not <em>big data</em>. Computationally speaking, this is not 
        much data at all: it's just a couple steps above trivial. Historically

        Big data, for my money, can be defined as data which cannot fit into

          href="http://nhgis.org">National Historical GIS</a>. But far more 
        information is available in the census records.

      The reliability of the censuses of religion has been defended in  
      Rodney Stark, “The Reliability of Historical United States Census 
      Data on Religion,” <i>Sociology of Religion</i> 53, no. 1 (1992): 
      91–95, doi:<a

        In conclusion, given how little data we've actually had to work with, 
        it's not surprising that the maps we have are open to criticisms. 
        Some of these problems are 
        inherent in the nature of mapping---you'll never find Emerson's "bard 
        of the Holy Ghost" or the autonomous 
        individual self, if there is such a thing---on a map like this. But 
        others are simply because we have not yet tapped the data that is out 
        there.
