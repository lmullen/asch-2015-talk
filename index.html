        On my desk I keep one reference work within easy reach: the <i>New 
          Historical Atlas of Religion in America</i>. It is not just that I 
        am fascinated by maps. When writing or teaching about any religious 
        group, I try to remember the dictum that I first learned from Jane 
        Kamensky: “events take place.” To bring place into my work, I need to 
        remind myself constantly of the where and when of American religious 
        history.

        University Press, 2001).

        But I also keep in mind Laurie Maffly-Kipps’s memorably titled essay 
        “If It’s South Dakota You Must Be Episcopalian.” In that essay 
        Maffly-Kipp reviews several atlases of American religion and makes a 
        number of telling critiques of the whole enterprise of mapping 
        religion, and indeed mapping in the humanities generally. Most of 
        these critiques can be lumped into two categories: sources and 
        definitions. First, sources: “We are still limited by data that is 
        partial, ambiguous, and clearly slanted toward things that can be 
        counted and people that traditionally have been seen as significant.” 
        In other words, our sources for making maps of religion aren’t very 
        good, and the best sources let us make maps of groups that we already 
        know a lot about. Second, definitions: Maffly-Kipp observes that our 
        “our dazzling new technologies and spatial theories” might only have 
        “brought us back to much more circumscribed definitions of religious 
        experience.” In other words, map-making requires us to create 
        categories, almost always denominational categories, when the whole 
        trend of religious history and religious studies is towards more 
        complex, layered understandings of religion.

        The scholars who have created the leading atlases of American religion 
        were not unaware of the theoretical questions raised by Maffly-Kipp, 
        and often raised them in their prefaces. Nor should we be overly 
        critical of the form of the <i>New Historical Atlas</i> or of Bret 
        Carrol's <i>Routledge Historical Atlas of Religion in America</i>. 
        When I look at these atlases, I see how they are straining the seams 
        of possibility when it comes to mapping in print. So my question is 
        this.  It seems to me that digital mapmaking means that we have new 
        possibilities for rethinking the forms and escaping the constraints of 
        mapmaking in print atlases (let alone in monographic scholarship). But 
        can digital mapmaking let us make maps which address the theoretical 
        constraints raised by both Maffly-Kipp and the mapmakers? How do we 
        get from the work of Gaustad
        et al. to the next step, while taking into account Maffly-Kipp's
        concerns?

        So within that framework, my aim is to show you two projects. The first
        is a class I taught on mapping Boston's religions. And, since I've done
        more interesting work since I submitted my abstract a year ago, I'm also
        going to sketch out the sources and methods for digital
        maps of religion on a much larger scale.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section class="text">
      <p>
        My general argument is that there are large sources of data which
        cartographers of religion have not used. They have not used them because
        they are unaware of them: I dare say that the scholars who created the
        atlases know the sources better than I currently do. Rather the problem
        is one of resolution. Those sources weren't adapted because they could
        never be meaningfully depicted in print atlases. The great difficulty
        with this work is comparison, which forces you into a least
        common-denominator approach, especially if you set your chronological
        scope so big so that you're dealing with radically different sources.
        Digital maps have the potential to improve some, but not all, of these
        questions. Our maps of religion so far have dealt with only a tiny 
        fraction of the information available to us. So I suggest that a 
        deeper map tells us more, and more humanistic, things about religious 
        history.
      </p>

      <p>
        Second, digital maps offer us many techniques for mapping. In 
        particular, they offer the possibility of dealing in more humanistic 
        Yes, indeed digital technology has a great deal of hubris, and to 
        repent of this hubris would take a longer litany than we have time for 
        today.  But I do think that digital maps offer the possibility for 
        better use of scale and change over time. While neither of these 
        entirely deals with the problem of mapping humanistically, they do 
        permit us to at least start to address these theoretical concerns. I'm 
        going to present this through a deep map of religion in Boston, and 
        then through a few extensive maps of Congregationalists.

        I don't want to criticize them 
        overly, but there are two complaints. First that they are focused on 
        comparison across denominations. But second they have a problem with 
        trying to make everything local to the time and place.

        This census data on religion is mostly available in the <a

        information is available in the census records.

      The reliability of the censuses of religion has been defended in  
      Rodney Stark, “The Reliability of Historical United States Census 
      Data on Religion,” <i>Sociology of Religion</i> 53, no. 1 (1992): 
      91–95, doi:<a

        Some of this is tracking down more information than simply number of 
        churches. (Number of churches, by the way, is a poor measure of 
        comparison, since Catholics and Jews for example had very large 
        congregations, while other denominations had very small 
        congregations.) The Census records contain far more information about 
        different denominations. I can't look at the volumes without learning 
        about some religious group I did not know about before. But there is 
        also more geographic specificity. Each of the censuses contains lists 
        of members and organizations in cities with more than 25,000 people. 
        None of us is likely to do a project on Council Bluffs, Iowa, or 
        Woonsocket, RI, but it is possible to know more than the Gaustad maps 
        come close to telling us.  For example, there are 292 cities of that 
        description in the 1926 census containing records by my count of 215 
        separate denominations.

        This is not <em>big data</em>. Computationally speaking, this is not 
        much data at all: it's just a couple steps above trivial. Historically 
        speaking, though, it is daunting. That means we are in a good place,

        Big data, for my money, can be defined as data which cannot fit into 
        RAM, or data where the size of the data approaches the size of the 
        population. This is neither.

        In conclusion, given how little data we've actually had to work with, 
        it's not surprising that the maps we have are open to criticisms of 
        the sort made by Maffly-Kipp and others. Some of these problems are 
        inherent in the nature of mapping---you'll never find the autonomous 
        individual self, if there is such a thing---on a map like this. But 
        others are simply because we have not yet tapped the
